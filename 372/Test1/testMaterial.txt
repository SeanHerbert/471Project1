front and back notes
timer stuff
sfr
port write pin read pin ddr 1 output, 0 input
a little basic git
commands: clone commit cvs dcvs 
one line code set bit/unset bit, toggle bit, bit shifting, making set and unset bits all at once
lab2 function take bits and set without modifing top ones
ISR's
comparison vector syntax _vect? PCINT triggers on rising and falling edges
don't memorize datasheet, pull up resistor--solves problem of floating pin 
shmidt trigger-- solves problem of noise
stuff on LCD-- look at timing diagram(voltage over time for pins and see which command was sent)
16 bit timer concepts of PWM duty cycle, tTotal, calc in OCR for 16 bit timer, prescaler
